        <li> Clear comments should explain **why the code exists**, not just what it does.</li>
        <li> If the comment is unclear, **the code should be rewritten**.</li>
        <li> Provide links to **external sources and references** where needed.</li>
        <li> Always **comment when fixing a bug** or marking incomplete implementations.</li>
    </ul>
