Developer Documentation


How to obtain source code
The source code is accessible through the Github project account. The source code can also be found in the final project hosted on the web. 

Planned Directory Structure
We are making a two-level directory structure. This is due to its ability to separate directories for each user. 

How to Build
The initial building block for this website is Next.js. Additional files will be added to implement future features.

How to Test
We will be doing black box testing specifically focusing on users who are in our target market, elderly and non technical users. 

Automated Build and Test 
There is no automated building and testing implemented currently but will be implemented as needed.

How to release a version 
Each new version will be released on GitHib.

Bug tracker (See Issues in GitHub)
Bugs will be tracked in a page called Issues located in GitHub.

GOOD comments should be found in any source code
We will use good commenting practices to make our code understandable to current and future users.

Rule 1: Comments should not duplicate the code.

Rule 2: Good comments do not excuse unclear code.

Rule 3: If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.

Rule 4: Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.

Rule 5: Explain unidiomatic code in comments.

Rule 6: Provide links to the original source of copied code.

Rule 7: Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.

Rule 8: Add comments when fixing bugs.

Rule 9: Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
